This is a replication analysis project from the paper: *"TAF10 Interacts with the GATA1 Transcription Factor and Controls Mouse Erythropoiesis"* (https://doi.org/10.1128/MCB.01370-14)
The data of this experiment are open-source and were downloaded from the GEO-Omnibus with accession number [GSE68083](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68083).
